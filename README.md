# Income Prediction Using Census Data (Adult Dataset)

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project predicts whether an individualâ€™s income exceeds $50K per year based on demographic and employment-related features from the UCI Adult dataset. It leverages pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for preprocessing, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

The dataset contains census information such as age, workclass, education, occupation, relationship, race, sex, hours per week, and native country.
